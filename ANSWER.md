How long did you spend on the coding test? 

    -I spent a few hours over this past week on this test

What would you add to your solution if you had more time?

    -I would modify the CurrencyRepository class to cache API results locally to an inmemory database
    and implement a TTL mechanism for that data, ensuring accurate results but also preventing excessive network calls. 
       
    -To make the UI a little more 'lively', I would load a flag asset for each item returned

    -Load countries in the spinner from the API on start up instead of hardcoding the array as an app resource

 If you didn't spend much time on the coding test then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.
